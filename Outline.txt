Title: The Cult across God’s River
By: Charles Adams

Plot: A stupid son of a bitchin KGB agent goes to the wrong town and finds out the hard way when he can’t escape a town ran by a cult.

It’s called God’s River because a cult dumps the bodies of the damned in it.  It got that name because there were sightings of angels flying over the river of “name” to take the victims from hell to heaven.  The KGB agent is required by the leader of Russia to be a catholic and is unaware of this river until the end.
